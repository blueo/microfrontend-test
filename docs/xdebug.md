`DDEV` have great [docs around xdebug](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/debugging-profiling/step-debugging/).


For specific set up instructions for PHPStorm, please see our [PHPStorm docs](phpstorm.md).

It will remain enabled until you start or restart the project.

Disable Xdebug for better performance when not debugging with `ddev xdebug off`.

Toggle Xdebug on and off easily with `ddev xdebug toggle`.
