# Contributing to project skeleton

Welcome to the Project Skeleton! We appreciate your interest in contributing to the project as the basis for all future Silverstripe sites.

Here are some key points to keep in mind as you consider contributing:

## :hammer_and_wrench: Contributing Code

- **Anyone can contribute code to the project.**
- To contribute code, create a pull request with your proposed changes.
- All code contributions must be approved by a project maintainer before being merged into the main branch of the project.
- If you are a project maintainer making changes to the code, your code should be approved by a senior developer or another project maintainer.

## :raised_hand: Raising Issues

- Anyone can raise an issue if they encounter a problem or have a suggestion for improvement.
- When raising an issue, be respectful and provide as much detail as possible.
- There are no bad ideas! All feedback is welcome and appreciated.

## :speech_balloon: Commenting on Issues

- Anyone can comment on an issue.
- When commenting, keep it respectful and constructive.
- Even if you don't have time to properly review a pull request, leaving a comment can be helpful.

## :mag_right: Peer Review

- Anyone can peer review a pull request.
- If you approve of the code changes, remember to add your approval.
- If you don't have time to properly review the code changes, leaving a comment can be helpful.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Merging Pull Requests

- To be merged, all code contributions must be approved by a maintainer.
- Sometimes pull requests can take a while to merge. If you find it is taking too long, consider adding more detail, examples, or screenshots to make the process easier for the person reviewing the code.

## :file_folder: Project Skeleton

- Project Skeleton is used for all projects and should be as un-opinionated as possible.
- It should contain code that is common to all projects, such as code that you always add in the early stages of a project.
- The Project Skeleton serves as a blueprint for other projects and shows what is required for updates.
- Your admin matters! Commit messages and pull requests are important, showing each step and ideally why the step was taken. These are often used to implement similar features in other projects, so make sure they are clear and well-documented.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about Project Skeleton, the changes you make will influence many awesome sites to come!
